            We are a Vancouver based company that offers all landscaping services throughout the lower mainland for the residential owner. We focus on quality service and environmental sustainability.

            We enjoy going beyond traditional landscaping practices, and exploring niches such as edible landscaping due to having a strong background and knowledge regarding farming plant care.

    <h1>Eating seasonally</h1>

        <p>
            Gardens can provide the base of a meal, as one incorporates produce that is ready in the garden into meals. Take a stroll outside, scope out what looks ready and which ingredients would complement each other nicely. Harvest the foods, take off any large leaves that can be composted, and bring the vegetables and fruits into the kitchen for cleaning. By preparing meals in this way, taste preferences are incorporated, as well as seasonal eating. In the winter, it is mostly cabbages, leaks, kale, turnips and Brussels sprouts that are harvestable, while the rest of the garden lays dormant.

In the late spring, early summer, lettuce, strawber­ries, herbs, small beets, beet greens, chard, radishes and green onions are now ready. In the summer we are blessed with the full bounty of harvest, with a seemingly unlimited selection. Then in the fall potatoes, parsnips and second rotations of onions and shallots are ready, in addition to winter raspberries. In this way, gardens are used to foster seed to table connections where food is grown, harvested, prepared, cooked and eaten. This reconnects folks to their local food system and re-incorporated self-sufficiency in the diet. In this way, food that is harvested can guide the meals that are prepared, rather than the conven­tional mindset of deciding what you want, finding it in the supermarket, and then preparing it.
